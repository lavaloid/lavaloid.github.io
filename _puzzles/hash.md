## Rules

-   **Normal sudoku rules apply.**  
    Every row, column, and 3 &times; 3 box contains all digits 1-9.
-   **Thermo rule applies.**  
    Digits increase from bulb to end.
-   **Mystery killer cage rule.**  
    Digits within a cage sums to the given expression in that cage. If there are two of them, then at least one must be true. The value of `x` is consistent in the whole grid.
