## Rules

-   **Normal sudoku rules apply.**  
    Every row, column, and 3 &times; 3 box contains all digits 1-9.
-   **Thermo rule applies.**  
    Along a thermometer, digits strictly increase from bulb to end.
-   **Killer rule applies.**  
    Digits in a cage sum to the number written in the corner of the cage. Digits may not repeat in a cage.
