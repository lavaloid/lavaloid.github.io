## Rules

-   **Normal heyawake rules apply.**  
    * The numbers indicate how many shaded cells there are in a region.  
    * Regions with no number may have any number of shaded cells.  
    * Unshaded cells cannot stretch across more than two regions in a straight line.  
    * Shaded cells cannot be connected orthogonally.  
    * All unshaded cells must be connected orthogonally.  
-   **Parity rule applies.**  
    A region with an E or O must have an even or odd number of shaded cells respectively. An E region may have zero shaded cells.
