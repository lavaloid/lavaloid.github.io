## Rules

**Normal double choco rules apply.**  
- Divide the grid into blocks by drawing solid lines over the dotted lines.
- A block must contain a pair of areas of white cells and gray cells having the same form (size and shape). One area may be a rotated or mirrored image of the other.
- A number indicates the number of cells of that color in the block; the number corresponds to half the number of cells of the block. A block can contain any number of cells with numbers.
- **In addition, given zero (0) is only for aesthetics and should be ignored.**
