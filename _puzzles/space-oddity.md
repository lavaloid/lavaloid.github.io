## Rules

-   **Normal sudoku rules apply.**  
    Every row, column, and 3 &times; 3 box contains all digits 1-9.
-   **Kropki rule applies. (No negative constraints)**  
    Cells separated by a white dot must be consecutive, and cells separated by a black dot must have a ratio of 1:2. A 1-2 pair can be either a white or black dot. Not all dots are given.
-   **Killer rule applies.**  
    Digits in a cage sum to the number written in the corner of the cage. Digits may not repeat in a cage.
